      <p class="descryption">CORDOVA is NOT the original name of the territory it represents. NOT even the Spanish name: CORDOBA. 
        Its territory comprises the original barrios ("balangays" in Cebuano) of Gabi, Day-as, and Pilipul (actually, Pilipog) all of which are located in the southeastern tip of Mactan Island.
       When Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Cebu on April 17, 1521, Mactan Island did not have a singular and unitary government.
        It was divided into barrios called BALANGAYS like Mactan, Pusok, Pajo, Agus, Pajac, Maribago, Gun-ob, Basak, Magondong, Suba-Basbas, Kalawisan, Babag, Pilipog, Day-as, and Gabi.
       Lapu-lapu was NOT the over-all ruler of the entire Mactan Island. He established alliances with the various chieftains in the different balangays like Bali-Alho, Bugto Pasan, Sampong Baha, and Magtawnas. 
       He was lucky to have gained their support. Collectively, they fought Magellan who invaded Lapu-lapu's MACTAN (a balangay headed by him).
       Lapu-lapu's victory in his balangay was not his alone. </p>

          <p class="lead">The Story</p>
        </div>
        <p class="descryption">On 22 May 186h3, the Spanish Governor General of the Philippines Rafael Echagüe y Bermingham (San Sebastián, 1815 - Madrid, 1887) created a new town comprising the barrios of Gabi, Day‑as and Pilipul (now called Pilipog), all of which are located on the southeastern tip of Mactan Island. 
            <br>Some authors think he chose the name Cordoba which means "stark nakedness and bare", 
            b ut they do not indicate in what language. 
            <br>The decree of becoming a municipality only became effective in 1864.</p></p>
